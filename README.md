# Guide

Add slash-command integration to slack:

Step 1.

Open up local port by running `npm run localtunnel`, copy link provided. Localtunnel provides access to your computers local port to the outside world so you don't need to host this guy.

Run `node index.js` in a different terminal.

Go to Slack's `slash-commands`, create a new slash command.

In the integration settings add in link generated by localtunnel.
